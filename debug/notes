General notes about the 6502 -
    
    - The order in which addresses are split across individual bytes
    in memory is Little Endian.

    - The memory map ranges from 0x0000 -> 0xFFFF.

    - RAM is accessible between 0x0000 -> 0x2000.

    - Stack ptr ranges from 0x0100 -> 0x1FF.

Flags -

    There is an internal 8-bit register, variously called the
    flags register, status register, or P register.
    Some programs check these bits and use the result of the check
    for whatever purpose the programmer has in mind.

    Bit 7: N flag (Negative flag) - Matches the highest-order bit of the result of whatever operation the CPU has completed.
    Ex: If we load FF (1111) into Y register, N will be set to 1 since MSB of 1111 = 1.

    Bit 6: V flag (Overflow flag) - This flag is important in 2s complement arithmetic.

    Bit 5: No name, always set to 1.

    Bit 4: B flag (Break flag) - Set to 1 whenever BRK instruction is cycled, cleared at other times. Rarely used.

    Bit 3: D flag (Decimal flag) - When D is set, the 6502 does arithmetic in BCD.

    Bit 2: I flag (Interrupt flag) - When I is set, the 6502 will not honor interrupts.

    Bit 1: Z flag (Zero flag) - The 6502 will set this flag to 1 when the result of any operation is 0.
    Ex: Loading X with 0x0 and Z flag will be set. Subtract 0x32 from 0x32 and we set the Z flag.

    Bit 0: C flag (Carry flag) - Set to 1 whenever accumulator rolls over from FF -> 00. Also set by various rotation and comparison instructions.


OPCODE NOTES - 

    Most instructions that explicitly reference memory have bit pattern
    aaabbbcc. aaa and cc determine the opcode, and bbb determines addressing mode.

    Ex: 
    0x25 -> 0b_001_001_01
    (aaa = 001) + (cc = 01) = AND opcode
    bbb = 001 Zero page addressing mode
